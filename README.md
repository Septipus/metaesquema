# metaesquema
Inspired by Hélio Oiticica's Metaesquemas series of paintings, I'm trying to re-interpret his geometric forms in a digital context.

The [MOMA](https://www.moma.org/artists/7715?locale=en) website offers a quick glance at his work, and a quick trip to his [wiki]()
entry is a very interesting read.

Of the series, the following captivated me most:

While on topic, can't forget [Seja marginal, seja herói](https://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/299661.html). (worth a read)
